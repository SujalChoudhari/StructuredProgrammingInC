# Structured Programming in C
By: Sujal Choudhari sjlchoudhari@gmail.com

# Introduction 

Since the late 19th century, C has been a popular programming language for general-purpose use. The C language was developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in the early 1970s. It has various diverse applications. It ranges from developing operating systems to databases. It is a system programming language used to do low level programming (e.g., driver or kernel). Even if it’s old,it is fast and is still a very popular programming language.⁣

* As the whole UNIX operating system was written in C, it has a strong association with the operating system⁣
* C has also been used widely while creating iOS and Android kernels.⁣

MySQL database is written using C.⁣ Ruby and Pearl are mostly written using C.⁣ Most part of Apache and NGINX is written using C.⁣ Embedded Systems are created using C⁣
